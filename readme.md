A simple **earthquake FiveM resource** is a custom script or mod designed to enhance gameplay on a FiveM server by introducing the simulation of an earthquake event. This resource allows server administrators or players with the appropriate permissions to trigger an earthquake within the game world at any time, adding a dynamic and immersive environmental effect.

### Key Features of the Earthquake Resource:
1. **Command Activation**: The resource comes with a simple command, typically `/earthquake`, which is used to trigger the earthquake event. This command is an easy-to-use trigger that allows for quick activation during gameplay, either for roleplay events, random occurrences, or specific moments in the game.

2. **Ace-Restricted Command**: The command to trigger the earthquake, `/earthquake`, is **Ace-restricted**. Ace permissions are used to define who can execute specific commands within a FiveM server. This ensures that only users with the appropriate permission (usually administrators or trusted players) can trigger the earthquake. Using Ace permissions adds an extra layer of control, preventing unauthorized users from causing disruptions or chaos by triggering an earthquake at inappropriate times.

3. **Simulation of Earthquake Effects**: When activated, the earthquake resource simulates various effects within the game world. This includes shaking the camera (to simulate the impact of the tremor), shaking the ground, and possibly affecting objects and vehicles. For added realism, buildings and structures might experience damage, and NPCs or players might react to the seismic activity. The severity and duration of the earthquake can be configured in the script, allowing administrators to adjust the event's intensity based on their preference.

4. **Customizable Settings**: Most simple earthquake resources come with configurable settings to adjust the frequency, strength, and duration of the earthquake. Administrators can tweak these settings based on the type of experience they want to offer on the server. For instance, a server focused on natural disaster roleplay might have more frequent or severe earthquakes, while a casual server might have earthquakes as rare, dramatic events.

5. **Roleplay Integration**: Earthquakes can be used to enhance roleplaying scenarios on the server. They can serve as the backdrop for emergency response roleplays, disaster management, or simply add excitement and challenge to daily activities. Players might need to react to the earthquake, seek shelter, or assist others in the aftermath, creating a unique and immersive gameplay experience.

6. **Server Resource Management**: The script is usually lightweight, meaning it won't heavily impact server performance. It will run efficiently in the background until triggered, ensuring that the main game experience is not disrupted, while still offering a unique event that can affect the gameplay environment.
